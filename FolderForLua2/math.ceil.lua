pi = 3.1415
three = math.floor(3.1415)
five = math.ceil(4.145)
print (pi) -- Something I've noticed is that this can answer really complex math questions. I think that is really extaordinary for a CPU.
print (three) -- Prints "3".
print (five) -- Prints "5".
-- The computer doesn't do anything if you don't type anything to do it. So that is what makes the computer a no-brainer.



five = 3 + 2
print (five)
print (2 + 2)
print (five + 1)
