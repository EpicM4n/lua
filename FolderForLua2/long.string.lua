hello = "hello, world"
-- Assign LENGTH to VARIABLES!
count_hash = #hello;
count_func = string.len(hello)
print ("The string:")
print (hello)
-- Print the ASSIGNED variables to the TOP! Meaning it's kind of going to repeat the same variables, but in a different way.
print ("Has a length of:")
print (count_hash)
print (count_func)
-- Use literal strings, but in place.
print (#"hello, world")
print (string.len("hello,world"))
-- See how that works? If you don't understand it go back and reread the previous chapters. It's not a simple concept to understand.
