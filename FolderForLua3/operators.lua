x = -7 -- Negation operator applied to the constant 7.
y = -x -- Negation operator applied to the x variable.
-- X:-7, y: 7



-- Binary operators.
x = 7 - 3 -- Operand 1 is the constant 7, Operand 2 is the constant 3.
y = x - 1 -- Operand 1 is the variable x, Operand 2 is the constant 1.
z = x - y -- Operand 1 is the variable x, Operand 2 is the variable y.
